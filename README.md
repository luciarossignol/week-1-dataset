**Soil artificialisation in metropolitan French urban spaces**

This data helps understanding what is called the process of soil « artificialisation » in French cities / counties / region. It is collected and organized by the French government. « Artificialisation » is a French term to designate the process of transforming a natural soil / a agricultural or forestal soil, into one that is more impermeable, waterproof, for transport building or housing building purposes. The data shows how many meters squares of data have been built between 2009 and 2021 in all counties / regions / cities in France. It also shows how much housing this artificialisation helped generate: the goal is to determine if it was « productive artificialisation », meaning, if it resulted in positive outcomes for locals, such as more public infrastructure, more housing etc. 

**Bicycle routes in NYC city**

This data from NYC OpenData locates all bicycle lanes and routes throughout the city. It could perhaps be interesting to work on comparing this data with housing market prices, to understand if/to what extent bike routes are more available in wealthier areas / areas where housing prices are higher.
